# Notifications

<span class="related-pages">#plugin/reminder</span>

Within Tasks, reminder notifications can be set using the standard Tasks format `⏲️ YYYY-MM-DD` for daily notifications at a set or by specifying the hour `⏲️ YYYY-MM-DD h:mm a`. Multiple reminders can be set by separating secondary reminders with a comma: `⏲️ 2000-03-24, 2000-03-28 10:05 am, 2000-03-31`

## How to complete the reminder

The reminder date doesn't change when completing the task, the date will change only when you complete it from the reminder popup or from the notification.
